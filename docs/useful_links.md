1. Working with on premises data and servers:
The gen3 system is optimized to deploy on cloud systems and work with cloud buckets. The Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) has developed [a collection of extensions](https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/compose-services/tree/onprem) to enable gen3 to work in a non aws environment.  Read this [overview](https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/compose-services/blob/onprem/onprem/README.md) for more information.
2. A group of users shared their experiences with setting up their Gen3 Data Commons on a local desktop using Compose Services in August 2020 in form of three videos: [Gen3 Data Commons Setup Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM54O4aMpWY), [Gen3 Data Commons Setup Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMmCxnbHpGo), and [Data Upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2EOtHPg6g8&feature=youtu.be). Please note, that the content in these videos might not reflect the current status of the Compose-Services repository. Referring to the video part 1, the following is outdated: the format of the `user.yaml` reflects the one shown in the Fence repository and the arborist DB setup is up to date.
3. A stand-alone data dictionary viewer for schema.json artifacts was published [here](https://github.com/bioteam/dictionary-visualizer).
4. A second group of users shared experiences with setting up Compose-Services and wrote documentation for different use cases (admin, user) as well as details on its deployment [here](https://github.com/umccr/gen3-doc). This group also created a [client](https://github.com/umccr/g3po) to work with Gen3.
